# PostgreSQL
This is  a Project which showcase the use of SQL(PostgreSQL) to analyze Sales Data from a fictional Company called Adventure Works and visualized with power BI. Exploratory Analysis was performed on the dataset to uncover insights, trends and patterns. The queries includes simply queries and also advanced queries. This Project demonstrates the usefulness and speed with which SQL helps us as Data analyst for analysis.

The Dataset can be found here on my GitHub page or on this link:  https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1NjvHdKmewMdOxJrAhtwpt8c1jwv57xCq?usp=sharing .  I got the Dataset from Microsoft while taking a Professional Certificate course on POWER BI.
